# Phishing project

## Introduction

For this phishing project, the aim is to create a web page resembling an authentic page (like a login form) and use tools like Webhook and Ngrok to retrieve the information sent by the user (username, password).
Bob has a dog (a bull terrier) named “Shimi”. Bob really loves his dog.
Alice has a passion for mechanics. She owns two vintage cars and often likes to parade around with her ancestral objects.
Your mission is to get the password from Alice or Bob.

Here are the steps to complete this project:

### 1. Reproduce the web page

Below you'll find the web page that looks like a typical authentication (example: login form with username and password fields) in HTML and CSS. Here is the page: [(index.html)]

### 2. Webhook

A webhook is a mechanism that allows one application or web service to send real-time notifications or data to another application via an HTTP request. It's a kind of “callback” used to enable two systems to communicate automatically when a specific event occurs.

For this step, we need to go on webhook.site, copy your webhook link and integrate it on your page to retrieve credentials entered on our webhook.

### 3. Github Pages

GitHub Pages is a GitHub feature that lets you host static websites directly from a GitHub repository, free of charge. It's an ideal solution for publishing personal projects, documentations, portfolios or presentation pages without having to manage a server infrastructure.

For this step, you just need to go on your repository then go on the Pages tab and config it.
